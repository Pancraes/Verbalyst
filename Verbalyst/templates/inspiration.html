    <h1 class="text-bold text-4xl text-center answer pb-5">The Story Behind Verbalyst</h1>
    <p class="answer">When the quarantine was introduced, many individuals, including us, were starved of social interactions. It was difficult transitioning from text-only interactions to fully-fledged conversations after the pandemic, let alone public speeches and presentations. Although enough time has passed to mend our abilities to speak to others and have fruitful conversations, speeches in front of large groups still stand as challenges that we'd rather not face. Knowing that the prevalence of social anxiety is increasing drastically in our society, we decided to tackle the issue that we and many others face with our app, Verbalyst.

    <h1 class="text-3xl text-center answer">But what even are speech impediments?</h1>
    <p class="text-center answer">There are several, but the main ones that Verbalyst looks for are stuttering and lisps.</p>

    <div class="answer py-8">
      <div class="mb-8">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Stuttering:</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">Stuttering, also known as a stutter, is a relatively common speech disorder characterized by disruptions in the flow of speech. It often involves repetitions, prolongations, or blocks on sounds or words. Here are some statistics:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Prevalence: Stuttering affects about 1% of the global population.</li>
              <li>Age of Onset: Stuttering typically starts between the ages of 2 and 7, often during a child's early language development.</li>
              <li>Gender: Stuttering is more common in males than females, with a ratio of approximately 3:1.</li>
              <li>Natural Recovery: Many children who stutter during their early years naturally recover without any intervention. For others, it may persist into adulthood.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mb-8">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Lisps:</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">Lisps are speech disorders characterized by difficulties in producing specific speech sounds, particularly "s" and "z" sounds. Here are some general statistics:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Prevalence: The prevalence of lisps can vary depending on the type and severity of the lisp. It's important to note that not all speech sound errors involving "s" and "z" are classified as lisps; some may be typical developmental errors.</li>
              <li>Developmental vs. Articulatory Lisps: Developmental lisps are common in young children and usually resolve with age and speech development. Articulatory lisps, caused by physical differences in the oral cavity, are less common and may require intervention.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
      
      <p class="mt-8">There are also some other blemishes that may occur in your speech, such as repetition, talking too fast, etc. Those are also tracked through Verbalystâ€™s AI.</p>

      <div class="py-8">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold">General tips:</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">Improving speech and communication skills is something that anyone can work on to enhance their overall communication effectiveness. Here are some tips and steps that an average person can follow to work on improving their speech:</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Practice Clear Pronunciation:</h3>
        <p>Focus on pronouncing words clearly and correctly. Pay attention to sounds you find challenging and practice saying them correctly.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Slow Down Your Speech:</h3>
        <p>Speaking too quickly can lead to unclear speech. Practice speaking at a moderate pace to ensure that your words are enunciated properly.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Record Yourself:</h3>
        <p>Use a voice recorder or smartphone to record yourself speaking. Listen to the recordings and identify areas where you can improve clarity or pronunciation.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Read Aloud:</h3>
        <p>Regularly read books, articles, or passages aloud. This practice can help improve your articulation, rhythm, and overall speaking fluency.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Expand Vocabulary:</h3>
        <p>A wider vocabulary allows you to choose the most appropriate words for different contexts, making your speech more engaging and effective.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Listen Actively:</h3>
        <p>Pay attention to how others speak. Listen to people with clear and expressive speech, and try to emulate their patterns.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Engage in Conversations:</h3>
        <p>Engage in conversations with diverse groups of people. This can help you adapt your speech to different styles and improve your ability to communicate effectively with various individuals.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Seek Feedback:</h3>
        <p>Ask friends, family members, or colleagues for constructive feedback on your speech. They can help identify areas for improvement that you might not notice yourself.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Use Online Resources:</h3>
        <p>There are numerous online resources, including videos, articles, and exercises, that can provide guidance on improving speech clarity, pronunciation, and communication skills.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Consider Professional Help:</h3>
        <p>If you have persistent concerns about your speech, consider consulting a speech-language pathologist (speech therapist). They can provide personalized assessment, guidance, and exercises to address specific areas of improvement.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Practice Breathing and Relaxation Techniques:</h3>
        <p>Good breath control and relaxation can positively impact your speech. Practice deep breathing and relaxation exercises to enhance your overall vocal control.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Stay Hydrated:</h3>
        <p>Adequate hydration is important for maintaining healthy vocal cords. Drink enough water throughout the day to support clear and comfortable speech.</p>
        
        <p class="mt-4">Remember, improving speech is a gradual process that takes time and consistent effort. The goal is not to eliminate uniqueness from your speech but to enhance clarity and effectiveness. Celebrate your progress and embrace your individuality as you work on becoming a more confident and effective communicator.</p>
