    <h1 class="text-bold text-4xl text-center answer pb-5">The Story Behind Verbalyst</h1>
    <p class="answer">When the quarantine was introduced, many individuals, including us, were starved of social interactions. It was difficult transitioning from text-only interactions to fully-fledged conversations after the pandemic, let alone public speeches and presentations. Although enough time has passed to mend our abilities to speak to others and have fruitful conversations, speeches in front of large groups still stand as challenges that we'd rather not face. Knowing that the prevalence of social anxiety is increasing drastically in our society, we decided to tackle the issue that we and many others face with our app, Verbalyst.

    <h1 class="text-3xl text-center answer">But what even are speech impediments?</h1>
    <p class="text-center answer">There are several, but the main ones that Verbalyst looks for are stuttering and lisps.</p>
    <div class="answer py-8 flex justify-between">
      <!-- Stuttering Section -->
      <div class="flex-1 mr-8">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center">Stuttering:</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">Stuttering, also known as a stutter, is a relatively common speech disorder characterized by disruptions in the flow of speech. It often involves repetitions, prolongations, or blocks on sounds or words. Here are some statistics:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Prevalence: Stuttering affects about 1% of the global population.</li>
              <li>Age of Onset: Stuttering typically starts between the ages of 2 and 7, often during a child's early language development.</li>
              <li>Gender: Stuttering is more common in males than females, with a ratio of approximately 3:1.</li>
              <li>Natural Recovery: Many children who stutter during their early years naturally recover without any intervention. For others, it may persist into adulthood.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
  
      <!-- Lisps Section -->
      <div class="flex-1">
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center">Lisps:</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">Lisps are speech disorders characterized by difficulties in producing specific speech sounds, particularly "s" and "z" sounds. Here are some general statistics:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Prevalence: The prevalence of lisps can vary depending on the type and severity of the lisp. It's important to note that not all speech sound errors involving "s" and "z" are classified as lisps; some may be typical developmental errors.</li>
              <li>Developmental vs. Articulatory Lisps: Developmental lisps are common in young children and usually resolve with age and speech development. Articulatory lisps, caused by physical differences in the oral cavity, are less common and may require intervention.</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="mt-8 text-center answer text-sm">There are also some other blemishes that may occur in your speech, such as repetition, talking too fast, etc. Those are also tracked through Verbalystâ€™s AI.</p>
